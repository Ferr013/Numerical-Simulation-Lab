Open the .ipynb to see the commented solution of the assigned exercises.
Each exercise is implemented in C++ and then the generated data is analyzed in Python3 through the notebooks uploaded here.


Here's a list of the exercises with a brief comment on what they are about:
- Ex01: 
        Generating simple statistical distribution true the inverse of the cumulative function. 
        Testing the Central Limit Theorem and stable distributions.
        Simulation of Buffon needle experiment to give a rough estimate of Pi.
- Ex02: 
        Uniform sampling vs Importance sampling
        Discrete and continous 3D-random walks mean distance from the origin.
- Ex03: 
        Simple finance simulation. Estimate the Put and Call value of an European option, comparing it with the analitic result from Black and Scholes algorithm
- Ex04: 
        Molecular Dynamics simulation with Verlet algorithm of a set of 100+ molecules interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential in periodic      boundary conditions.
        Implementing a thermal stabilization algorithm, step by step evaluation of kinetic and potential energies, temperature, pressure.
        Applying the simulation to Argon and Krypton in solid, liquid and gaseous phases, retrieving coherent phisical values for the observed quantities.
- Ex05: 
        Metropolis algorithm. Evaluating hydrogenic probability distribution for 1S and 2P energy levels.
